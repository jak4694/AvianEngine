# Avian Documentation

Avian is an all-purpose 2D game engine. 
There are two major parts to this documentation, **AvianEditor** and **AvianCore**.

## AvianEditor
AvianEditor is the actual tool that the users who develop games interact with.
The documentation primarily serves users of the engine, with the goal of understanding the different tools in the editor.
The documentation also goes into technical explaination of functions and objects found in AvianCore that developers would regularly use in making their games.

## AvianCore
AvianCore is the group of classes and logic that makes up what AvianEngine uses as its game logic.
The documentation primarily serves developers and contributors to the engine, with a goal of understanding the implementation and how everything works under the hood.
Here is an overview of all the major classes that make up AvianCore and how they are related:
